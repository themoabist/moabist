On Debt

I was talking to friend that works for one of the big names in finance this week and he started using the terminology “Good Debt.” I hate this.

Let me just speak frankly.

Shut the frick up. There is no such thing as good debt.

For the record. All debt is bad debt. I read these articles asking whether they should pay off your school debt or invest…

Pay off your debt. Better yet don’t get into debt. Don’t use money that you don’t have to buy things with debt that you don’t need.  Don’t buy things that with debt that will depreciate in value and will not pay for itself.

Debt Increases Risk

Debt always increases risk. Always.

For instance, I buy a house. The value of this house will either increase or decrease over the next couple of years. This is average risk. The markets have done pretty good in the past (cough… minus the last couple of years). There’s a pretty good chance that the property value will increase over the long run.

Now if I finance the house. I guarantee that I’ll make a payment each month plus interest. This a great deal for the bank. For you, not so much. You’re the one taking the risk. Whether the value of the house goes up or down, your payment and interest guarantee remain the same.

If you’re paying $10,000 extra in interest (a good round number) and the property value decrease by $10,000 a year.  You’re out $20,000.

On the opposite if the property value increase by $10,000 over the year. Most people pat themselves on the back.

Actually you’ve just broken even… Congratulations…. You’ve made no money.

Stop paying  other people for the risks you’re taking.

 

How to use debt

Now I’m not saying that I never use debt. I’m saying that in an ideal world I would never use debt. I do only use two types of debt:

Debt that has a high potential of paying for itself.
Debt that I can pay off tomorrow.
Everything else I pay for in cash.

Let me expound. The first type of debt is for investments. These have income potential. Not theoretical income actual income. They may not have turned profitable yet, but they have the potential to.

Examples of 1:

A property that has some form of rental income that will cover the mortgage (i.e duplex, mother-in-law, nightly rental)
Borrowed money to fulfill orders of which I have in hand or can highly expect to repeat due to order history
Subsidized school loan (if you pick a major that actually has job prospects). Be ready to pay them off at graduation.
Debt in category 2 is really for convenience. I use credit cards to pay for items, but only when I have the money to pay them off immediately.

Pay for everything else in cash.

 

Examples that don’t fit into these categories (pay for these in cash):

A home without income potential
A car
Travel
Life Events
Pretty much everything else

Vacation Rental

The Plan

I invest 20% in a down-payment on house plus an additional ~$10,000 to furnish it. I then rent on airbnb. I carry the mortgage and self manage the property. I have picked a highly attractive destination. The condo is being built as we speak.

Due Dilligence

I believe in doing my due diligence prior to jumping into something. I’m sure I’m missing some, but a good portion of the tasks can be found below:

Talked to a property manager
Tracked down a potential cleaner
Check out listing websites
Verified that the hoa allows nightly rentals
Verified Zoning laws allow nightly rentals (may charge an additional tax)
Found 7 comparable properties on Airbnb
Started approval process from Mortgage company
Received approximate lending rate
Ran the numbers to provide estimates (these will be discussed below)
Don’t Use a Property Manager

Consequently, I talked to a property management company in the process. They told me they would kindly take 40% of my profits for doing the same stuff that would take me about 2 hours a week to manage. Plus they pass the charge back to me if anything gets damaged and they have to repair it. I still have to furnish the place. I think they might replace the lock and provide a $30 dollar lockbox.  On the plus side they do have their own website that gets less traffic than airbnb or vbro. Seriously though… don’t use a property a property manger.

Sidenote: I may have to start a property management company. In my state you need a real estate license to start one. I might have to add it to the future experiment list.

VBRO

VBRO has a subscription option or  a percent based model. The subscription fee starts at 399  or 33.25 a month. The percent based model is equivalent to airbnb.

AirBnb

Airbnb takes 5 % off the top and then 3% of what they pay you. Ultimately I decided to go with AirBnb because of the hype and usability of the mobile platform. Ultimately it comes down to user base, and I think Airbnb has it right now.

The Numbers

Here are the numbers I came up with as estimated monthly costs.

Est Mort payment	hoa	Tax/Ins/util	Est monthly
$1,138.89	$95.00	$500.00	$1,733.89
 

I quickly calculated the booking rate for the comparables directly from the booking websites and extrapolated that over the year.

Comparables	Price	Cleaning Fee	March Booking Rate	Monthly Gross Est	Yearly Gross Est	Yearly Net Est
1	$135.00	$80.00	88%	$3,661.88	$43,942.50	$23,135.83
2	$171.00	$61.00	55%	$2,907.00	$34,884.00	$14,077.33
3	$171.00	$61.00	19%	$1,026.00	$12,312.00	-$8,494.67
4	$189.00	$95.00	42%	$2,457.00	$29,484.00	$8,677.33
5	$171.00	$61.00	23%	$1,197.00	$14,364.00	-$6,442.67
6	$189.00	$95.00	16%	$945.00	$11,340.00	-$9,466.67
7	$196.00	$95.00	29%	$1,764.00	$21,168.00	$361.33
It should be noted that these are pretty conservative numbers. The estimated monthly payment is high and the booking rate is during a low traffic month.

Also, interest and a number of start up costs are deductible so that provides another bit of padding for the negative numbers.

It should also be noted that even at a net profit of 0% I am still winning because I’m still gaining equity in the property. Plus, I get to use it whenever I visit the area.

The Risks

The biggest risk is the property tanking. Properties in this area have been pretty recession proof, but it’s still a possibility.

I figure worst case scenario I lose about $10,000 and sell it in a year. At any rate most of the loss would provide a tax deduction.

 

Okay so really worst case scenario the market housing market tanks and I’m out the 20% I put down. That’s not likely and accounted for risks are what make the experiment fun.

 

More to come….

Tax planning 2

The first step in reducing tax burden is to reduce taxable income. The government allows a couple common vessels to use in reducing income.

401k (or 403b)

You can shield up to $18000 (for year 2016). Plus there is generally an employee match contribution. Your 401k provider should give you investment options. Choose strategic Index funds to put your money into. Avoid mutual funds.

IRA

You can shield up to $5500 (for year 2016). You can fund both a 401k and an IRA. The deduction for the IRA starts getting phased out at certain income limits. Again put these into index funds.

Roth Vs Traditional

People get confused on this all of the time. Both 401k’s and IRA come in either Roth or Traditional. Traditional– you don’t have to pay taxes on it now, but you pay taxes when you withdraw later. You can’t touch the money without penalty’s. Roth– you pay taxes now and don’t pay taxes later. You can pull out the money you’ve contributed but not the interest. I’m going to talk about the game-plan for choosing Traditional over Roth in another post, so you’ll just have to trust me for now. Choose Traditional 401k and Traditional IRA.

HSA (or FSA)

You can shield up to $3500 (for year 2016 $2500 for an FSA). To contribute to an HSA your insurance plan needs to meet the criteria for an HSA. HSA’s may be superior to 401k and IRA when it comes to withdrawing funds so make sure to contribute to this. FSA’s are use it or lose it so HSA’s are superior.

Catch up Contributions

If you’re over an age (usually 50) there are additional amounts that you can shield from taxes. Google each of these to figure out the amount.

Families

Most of these limits double for filing as head of household. Again google is your friend to track down these limits.

Tax Planning: The Fundamentals

Everyone pays them. Most don’t understand them. We want less of them. What if I told you it’s possible to pay no taxes at all? I’m all for contributing to righteous causes and supporting the country/government/troops, but then you hear about how millions are wasted on health care and about how politicians are dumping our money into such and such failed project, while our countries debt increases by trillions. The bottom line is: I feel I should be able to control the money I’ve earned. These posts on tax planning are meant to demonstrate how one man legally mitigates his tax burden to allow greater control of his finances. The basis for tax planning is determined by how our tax burden is calculated. This will be explained in the numbers section below. We’re starting with really basic stuff, so move on to future posts if this is too simplistic.

 

The Numbers

The IRS publishes a tax bracket each year.

There are four categories:

Single Filers
Married Filing Jointly
Married Filing Separately
Head of Household
Brackets are Shown as a percent and are calculated as you “fill up” the bracket.

For example the tax bracket for 2015 are:

Rate	Single	Married Joint	Married Separate	Head of Household
10%	$1- $9,225	$1-$18,450	$1-$9,225	$1-$13,150
15%	$9,226-$37,450	$18,451-$74,900	$9,226-$37,450	$13,151-$50,200
25%	$37,451-$90,750	$74,901-$151,200	$37,451-$75,600	$50,201-$129,600
28%	$90,751-$189,300	$151,201-$230,450	$75,601-$115,225	$129,601-$209,850
33%	$189,301-$411,500	$230,451-$411,500	$115,226-$205,750	$209,851-$411,500
35%	$411,501-$413,200	$411,501-$464,850	$205,751-$232,425	$411,501-$439,200
39.6%	$413,200+	$464,850+	$232,425+	$439,200+
 

If single filers make $5,000 dollars of taxable income, they pay $5,000 * 10% = $500.

Here’s where most people don’t understand…

If they make $10,000 dollars, they pay 10% on $9,225 and 15% on $10,000 – $9,225 = $775.

So the total would be $9225 * 10% + $775 * 15% = $922.5 + $116.25.

 

Easy enough. Right?

 

There are a few definitions I’ve glazed over, but I’ll cover them in future posts. We’ll especially need to define taxable income.

 

Here is a simple calculator that I’ve written to allow you to play around with the calculations.
