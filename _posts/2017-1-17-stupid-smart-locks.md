I don't like any of the existing solutions out there for smart locks. They're much too complicated.

The things I don't like:

* Price range of over $200
* A hub is required for them to do anything interesting
* They're complicated to setup
* You have no control over server they connect to
* Bluetooth functionality is almost unusable
* Company specific Apps that are almost unusable

I could rant about this all day. Why can't someone make a lock that's as easy and intuitive to use as a nest.

I'm annoyed and have started building one myself.

My requirements:

* Cost of $99 to customer
* Wifi built in (no hub required)
* Bluetooth built in
* Server control with Api
* Keypad for code access
* Keyed access for battery failure
* Automatic statistic collection of entry times and exit times

Stretch goals:

* Point the lock to your own server
* Camera that auto snaps a photo everytime the lock is messed with and uploads it to the server
* Speaker for voice streaming

I've found a manufacturer in China that will allow to put my brand on their manufacturered lock for a prototype.
I'm going to remove their electronics and replace it my desired IOT chip.
