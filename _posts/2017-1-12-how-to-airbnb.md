# The closest I've come to passive income.

I decided I wanted to pick up a nightly rental in one of my favorite vacation spots. I started researching the location and pulling comparable rental rates from similar properties off Airbnb in the area.
I selected a property, found a real estate agent and closed.
I set a goal to have it ready to rent in three weeks. It was quite a bit of work to get it up and running. I tracked down a cleaner in the area and got it listed on Airbnb.

I was bombarded with reservations. Success right!

Not quite.
The day in and day out of running the rental was actually pretty stressful. I would have to remember to send emails and text the guests I waited by my phone to make sure the guests got in with no complications.
I was still working full time and it was getting annoying.
I started looking into options.

* Property manager: I called three or four property managers and got quotes. The average for the area was the property managers where asking on average 30-40 %. That definitely wasn't happening.
* [Guesty](https://www.guesty.com/): Handles the appointment but they take 2-5%. Honestly I think a percentage is too much to pay for what they're doing. It takes like 15 to 20 minutes a day but it is time critical.
* [Lodgify](https://www.lodgify.com/): Allows you to integrate with multiple sites, but doesn't provide the automation level I was looking for.

I'm a tech guy by trade so if I can't find the solution I like, I generally with a little bit of resentment start building it myself.

## How I operate now
I built a web service that integrates with Airbnb. It allows me to automatically send time critical information to the customer.
I bought a door lock that I can program remotely. This let's me give each customer a door code.
This also requires a internet connected hub. After research I ended after doing buying a wink hub.
Consequently I don't really like a lot of the smart locks that exist and have decided to build my own. [More on that here]()

The web service automatically texts me and reminds me to change the code.
It also automatically sends a email to my  cleaner with all of the cleanings for the coming week.
Essentially all I have to do now is change the door code when I get an text from my server. Less than 10 seconds a day.

Wait for the cash to roll in.

Gross income in the first six months $33,000. See more about profits it here.
